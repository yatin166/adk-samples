## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

*   **Google Cloud Account:** You need a Google Cloud account with BigQuery enabled.
*   **Python 3.9+:** Ensure you have Python 3.9 or a later version installed.
*   **Poetry:** Install Poetry by following the instructions on the official Poetry website: [https://python-poetry.org/docs/](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
*   **Git:** Ensure you have git installed. If not, you can download it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the [installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).



### Project Setup with Poetry

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
    cd google-adk-samples/agents/data-science
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies with Poetry:**

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

    This command reads the `pyproject.toml` file and installs all the necessary dependencies into a virtual environment managed by Poetry.

3.  **Activate the Poetry Shell:**

    ```bash
    poetry env activate
    ```

    This activates the virtual environment, allowing you to run commands within the project's environment.
    Make sure the environment is active. If not, you can also activate it through

     ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Rename the file ".env-example" to ".env"
    Fill the below values:

    ```bash
    # Choose Model Backend: 0 -> ML Dev, 1 -> Vertex
    GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=1

    # ML Dev backend config. Fill if using Ml Dev backend.
    GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_VALUE_HERE'

    # Vertex backend config
    GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT='YOUR_VALUE_HERE'
    GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION='YOUR_VALUE_HERE'
    ```

    Follow the following steps to set up the remaining environment variables.

5.  **BigQuery Setup:**
    These steps will load the sample data provided in this repository to BigQuery.
    For our sample use case, we are working on the Forecasting Sticker Sales data from Kaggle:

    _Walter Reade and Elizabeth Park. Forecasting Sticker Sales. https://kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e1, 2025. Kaggle._

    *   First, set the BigQuery project ID in the `.env` file. This can be the same GCP Project you use for `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`,
        but you can use other BigQuery projects as well, as long as you have access permissions to that project.
        If you have an existing BigQuery table you wish to connect, specify the `BQ_DATASET_ID` in the `.env` file as well.
        Make sure you leave `BQ_DATASET_ID='forecasting_sticker_sales'` if you wish to use the sample data.

        Alternatively, you can set the variables from your terminal:

        ```bash
        export BQ_PROJECT_ID='YOUR-BQ-PROJECT-ID'
        export BQ_DATASET_ID='YOUR-DATASET-ID' # leave as 'forecasting_sticker_sales' if using sample data
        ```

        You can skip the upload steps if you are using your own data. We recommend not adding any production critical datasets to this sample agent.
        If you wish to use the sample data, continue with the next step.

    *   You will find the datasets inside 'data-science/data_science/utils/data/'.
        Make sure you are still in the working directory (`agents/data-science`). To load the test and train tables into BigQuery, run the following commands:
        ```bash
        python3 data_science/utils/create_bq_table.py
        ```


6.  **BQML Setup:**
    The BQML Agent uses the Vertex AI RAG Engine to query the full BigQuery ML Reference Guide.

    Before running the setup, ensure your project ID is added in .env file: `"GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT"`.
    Leave the corpus name empty in the .env file: `BQML_RAG_CORPUS_NAME = ''`. The corpus name will be added automatically once it's created.

    To set up the RAG Corpus for your project, run the methods `create_RAG_corpus()` and `ingest_files()` in
    `data-science/data_science/utils/reference_guide_RAG.py` by running the below command from the working directory:

    ```bash
    python3 data_science/utils/reference_guide_RAG.py
    ```


7.  **Other Environment Variables:**

    *   `CODE_INTERPRETER_EXTENSION_NAME`: (Optional) The full resource name of
        a pre-existing Code Interpreter extension in Vertex AI. If not provided,
        a new extension will be created. (e.g.,
        `projects/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/locations/<YOUR_LOCATION>/extensions/<YOUR_EXTENSION_ID>`).
        Check the logs/terminal for the ID of the newly created Code Interpreter
        Extension and provide the value in your environment variables to avoid
        creating multiple extensions.

    From the terminal:

    ```bash
    export CODE_INTERPRETER_EXTENSION_NAME='projects/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/locations/us-central1/extensions/<YOUR_EXTENSION_ID>'
    ```

## Running the Agent

You can run the agent using the ADK command in your terminal.
from the working directory:

1.  Run agent in CLI:

    ```bash
    poetry run adk run data_science
    ```

2.  Run agent with ADK Web UI:
    ```bash
    poetry run adk web
    ```
    Select the data_science from the dropdown



### Example Agent Interaction

Here's a quick example of how a user might interact with the Data Science Multi-Agent System:

> Â´**User:** Hi, What data do you have access to?

> **Agent:**  I have access to two tables: `train` and `test`. Both tables contain sticker sales data with the following columns: `id`, `date`, `country`, `store`, `product`, and `num_sold`.

> **User:** I need more details on the train table. What countries exist? How many stores are there?

> **Agent:** Result: The train table contains data from Canada, Finland, Italy, Kenya, Norway, and Singapore. Each of these countries has 3 distinct stores.

>Explanation: The database agent executed a SQL query against the train table to find the distinct countries and the number of distinct stores within each country. The query grouped the results by country and counted the distinct store values.

> **User:** Please generate a plot with total sales per country.

> **Agent:**  Result: A bar plot has been generated showing the total sales per country. The x-axis represents the country, and the y-axis represents the total sales.

> Explanation:
> 1. The database agent was first called to retrieve the total sales per country from the train table.
> 2. The data science agent was then called to generate a bar plot visualizing the results. The plot displays each country on the x-axis and its corresponding total sales on the y-axis.

> **User:** What kinds of forecasting models can I train in BQML?

> **Agent:** You can train several types of forecasting models in BQML, including ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) models. Would you like to proceed with training a forecasting model?

> **User:** Yes

> **Agent:** Okay, before proceeding, let's confirm the project and dataset ID for BQML. We'll be using the `PROJECT_ID` project and the `forecasting_sticker_sales` dataset. Does that sound right?

> **User:** Yes

> **Agent:** The BQML supports `ARIMA_PLUS`, `ARIMA_PLUS_XREG`.

>To proceed, I need to know which model you'd like to use. I also need to know the following:

>*   The name of the column that provides the time points (e.g., 'date').
>*   The name of the column that contains the data to forecast (e.g., 'num_sold').
>*   Do you want to fit and forecast multiple time series using a single query? If so, what are the ID columns? (e.g., `country`, `store`, `product`)


## Running Evaluations


Evaluation tests assess the overall performance and capabilities of the agent in a holistic manner.

**Run Evaluation Tests:**

    ```bash
    poetry run pytest eval
    ```


- This command executes all test files within the `eval/` directory.
- `poetry run` ensures that pytest runs within the project's virtual environment.



## Running Tests

Tests assess the overall executability of the agents.

**Test Categories:**

*   **Integration Tests:** These tests verify that the agents can interact correctly with each other and with external services like BigQuery. They ensure that the root agent can delegate tasks to the appropriate sub-agents and that the sub-agents can perform their intended tasks.
*   **Sub-Agent Functionality Tests:** These tests focus on the specific capabilities of each sub-agent (e.g., Database Agent, BQML Agent). They ensure that each sub-agent can perform its intended tasks, such as executing SQL queries or training BQML models.
*   **Environment Query Tests:** These tests verify that the agent can handle queries that are based on the environment.

**Run Tests:**

    ```bash
    poetry run pytest tests
    ```

- This command executes all test files within the `tests/` directory.
- `poetry run` ensures that pytest runs within the project's virtual environment.



## Deployment on Vertex AI Agent Engine

To deploy the agent to Google Agent Engine, first follow
[these steps](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/set-up)
to set up your Google Cloud project for Agent Engine.

You also need to give BigQuery User and BigQuery Data Viewer permissions to the
Reasoning Engine Service Agent. Run the following commands to grant the required
permissions:

```bash
export RE_SA="service-${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_NUMBER}@gcp-sa-aiplatform-re.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT} \
    --member="serviceAccount:${RE_SA}" \
    --condition=None \
    --role="roles/bigquery.user"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT} \
    --member="serviceAccount:${RE_SA}" \
    --condition=None \
    --role="roles/bigquery.dataViewer"
```

Next, you need to create a `.whl` file for your agent. From the `data-science`
directory, run this command:

```bash
poetry build --format=wheel --output=deployment
```

This will create a file named `data_science-0.1-py3-none-any.whl` in the
`deployment` directory.

Then run the below command. This will create a staging bucket in your GCP project and deploy the agent to Vertex AI Agent Engine:

```bash
python3 deployment/deploy.py --create
```

When this command returns, if it succeeds it will print an AgentEngine resource
name that looks something like this:
```
projects/************/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/7737333693403889664
```
The last sequence of digits is the AgentEngine resource ID.

Once you have successfully deployed your agent, you can interact with it
using the `test_deployment.py` script in the `deployment` directory. Store the
agent's resource ID in an environment variable and run the following command:

```bash
export RESOURCE_ID=...
export USER_ID=<any string>
python test_deployment.py --resource_id=$RESOURCE_ID --user_id=$USER_ID
```

The session will look something like this:
```
Found agent with resource ID: ...
Created session for user ID: ...
Type 'quit' to exit.
Input: Hello. What data do you have?
Response: I have access to the train and test tables inside the forecasting_sticker_sales dataset.
...
```

Note that this is *not* a full-featured, production-ready CLI; it is just intended to
show how to use the Agent Engine API to interact with a deployed agent.

The main part of the `test_deployment.py` script is approximately this code:

```python
from vertexai import agent_engines
remote_agent = vertexai.agent_engines.get(RESOURCE_ID)
session = remote_agent.create_session(user_id=USER_ID)
while True:
    user_input = input("Input: ")
    if user_input == "quit":
      break

    for event in remote_agent.stream_query(
        user_id=USER_ID,
        session_id=session["id"],
        message=user_input,
    ):
        parts = event["content"]["parts"]
        for part in parts:
            if "text" in part:
                text_part = part["text"]
                print(f"Response: {text_part}")
```

To delete the agent, run the following command (using the resource ID returned previously):
```bash
python3 deployment/deploy.py --delete --resource_id=RESOURCE_ID
```



## Optimizing and Adjustment Tips

*   **Prompt Engineering:** Refine the prompts for `root_agent`, `bqml_agent`, `db_agent`
    and `ds_agent` to improve accuracy and guide the agents more effectively.
    Experiment with different phrasing and levels of detail.
*   **Extension:** Extend the multi-agent system with your own AgentTools or sub_agents.
    You can do so by adding additional tools and sub_agents to the root agent inside
    `agents/data-science/data_science/agent.py`.
*   **Partial imports:** If you only need certain capabilities inside the multi-agent system,
    e.g. just the data agent, you can import the data_agent as an AgentTool into your own root agent.
*   **Model Selection:** Try different language models for both the top-level
    agent and the sub-agents to find the best performance for your data and
    queries.


## Troubleshooting

*   If you face `500 Internal Server Errors` when running the agent, simply re-run your last command.
    That should fix the issue.
*   If you encounter issues with the code interpreter, review the logs to
    understand the errors. Make sure you're using base-64 encoding for
    files/images if interacting directly with a code interpreter extension
    instead of through the agent's helper functions.
*   If you see errors in the SQL generated, try the following:
    - including clear descriptions in your tables and columns help boost performance
    - if your database is large, try setting up a RAG pipeline for schema linking by storing your table schema details in a vector store
